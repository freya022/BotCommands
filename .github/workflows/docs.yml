# This workflow builds the docs and uploads them to a subdirectory of a staging repository.
# The staging repository is used as more than one workflow can modify the website's content.
# A gh-pages branch could have been used, but this wasn't possible as it would trigger webhooks.

# So the goal here is to create the outputs, write them to the remote repo,
# then grab the entire staging repo and publish it, since it will contain all the merged content.
