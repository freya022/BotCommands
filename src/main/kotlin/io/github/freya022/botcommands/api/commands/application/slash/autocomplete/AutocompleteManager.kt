    /**
     * Declares an autocomplete function for slash command options.
     *
     * The name must be unique; I recommend naming them similarly to:
     * `YourClassSimpleName: AutocompletedField` (for example, `SlashTag: tagName`).
     *
     * Requirements:
     *  - The method must be public
     *  - The method must be non-static
     *  - The first parameter must be [CommandAutoCompleteInteractionEvent]
     *
     * The given function must return a [Collection], which gets processed differently based on its element type:
     *  - `String`, `Long`, `Double`: Makes a choice where `name` == `value`,
     *  uses fuzzy matching to give the best choices first
     *  - `Choice`: Keeps the same choices in the same order, does not do any matching.
     *  - Any type supported by an [AutocompleteTransformer]: Keeps the same order after transformation.
     *
     * You can add support for more element types with [autocomplete transformers][AutocompleteTransformer].
     *
     * ## State-aware autocomplete
     * You can also use state-aware autocomplete,
     * meaning you can get what the user has inserted in other options.
     *
     * The requirements are as follows:
     *  - The parameters must be named the same as in the original slash command.
     *  - The parameters of the same name must have the same type as the original slash command.
     *  - The parameters can be in any order, include custom parameters or omit options.
     *
     * **Note:** Parameters refers to method parameters, not Discord options.
